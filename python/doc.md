# About Numbers
Python has three different types of built-in numbers: integers (int), floating-point (float), and complex (complex). Fractions (fractions.Fraction) and Decimals (decimal.Decimal) are also available via import from the standard library.

Whole numbers including hexadecimal (hex()), octal (oct()) and binary (bin()) numbers without decimal places are also identified as ints.

Python fully supports arithmetic between these different number types, and will convert narrower numbers to match their less narrow counterparts when used with the binary arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, and %).
